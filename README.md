# Courses
This is a java-based web server.
It was developed for a graduate app-development course, by myself, Ryan Corrigan, and Justin Madlock.
It uses a built-in webserver, thanks to the Java Spark library, and a file-based MySQLite instance.

##Installation
Use gradle to install the packages and build the project.
There's a fatjar gradle build step that produces a single .jar for use in the docker container.
